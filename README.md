# LittleOwlSurvival
Analysis of first-year survival of Little Owls in Germany.

This repository aims to replicate the analyses of Marco Perrig's PhD thesis, analysing the seasonal survival probability of Little Owls based on radio-telemetry of >300 individuals. Originally only data from 1 Aug until the following breeding season were included, but after a meeting on 26 Sept 2023 we agreed to also include the post-fledging period to report annual survival.

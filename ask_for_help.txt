Hi, I am intrigued by a very simple CJS model to estimate annual survival of juvenile little owls (n=307) from telemetry data. Between 2009 and 2011 we tracked 307 individuals over their first year of life (from fledging in June to July in the following year) at biweekly intervals. Our goal was to estimate survival at high resolution (biweekly encounter occasions) to understand whether post-fledging, dispersal, or winter function as survival 'bottlenecks'. I have fitted several CJS models with a range of covariates and with or without random effects, but the estimated mean annual survival is always too low (most basic model without any covariates or random effects, mean 0.12, 95%CI 0.068-0.156) compared to the 50 animals (16%) that we tracked (and were known to be alive) until the last 2 encounter occasions. Fränzi recommended yesterday to 'condense' encounter occasions (from 2 weeks to 4 weeks) but that unfortunately did not solve the problem. If anybody has any ideas how/why survival can be estimated lower than what is actually observed please let me know. The ⁠data and model codes are here, and you can replicate the model by running the script ⁠LIOW_telemetry_survival_basic.r. Thank you for any help!
